              <span className="blue-text">Research Article Evaluation:</span>{" "}
              The primary responsibility of a Publishing Editor is to carefully
              review the articles submitted for editorial assessment, and decide
              on how they move ahead in their publishing journey.

              definition have a wider scope of acceptance than conventional
              journals. They evaluate the contribution an article makes to the
              discipline as opposed to the uniqueness or novelty of the
              research.
            </p>

            <p className="pera-text">
              <span className="blue-text">Editorial Assessment:</span>{" "}
              Publishing Editors should carefully evaluate the research article
              submitted to the platform. They should assess the originality,
              scientific rigor, methodology, significance, and ethical
              considerations of the research.
            </p>

            <p className="pera-text">
              <span className="blue-text">Peer Review Management:</span>
              Publishing Editors will decide to process a research article
              through automated workflow on Aakashganga platform for Peer
              Review. They will do this after evaluating the merit of the
              presented research. The system will let you know if an author has
              opted for a Pre-Publishing Double Blind Peer Review or a Post
              Publishing Open Review.
            </p>

            <p className="pera-text">
              All editors have a crucial obligation to maintain the
              confidentiality of the peer-review process. They must refrain from
              disclosing any information pertaining to a manuscript to
              individuals not involved in the peer-review process. In cases
              where a submitted manuscript is deemed unsuitable for the Mega
              Journal or falls outside its scope, the editors have the authority
              to reject it without undergoing formal peer review.

              <span className="blue-text">Editorial Decision-making:</span>
              Publishing Editors will make informed decisions regarding the
              acceptance, revision, or rejection of manuscripts based on the
              results of the peer review process and in alignment with the
              journalâ€™s editorial policies and standards.

            <h2 className="large-title">Editorial Independence</h2>

            <p className="pera-text">
              Publishing Editors should ensure that they are making decisions
              based on the academic quality and relevance of submitted
              manuscripts, without any external influence or conflicts of
              interest.
            </p>

            <h2 className="large-title">Ethical Considerations</h2>

            <p className="pera-text">
              Editors should be vigilant about potential ethical concerns, such
              as plagiarism, use of profane words, duplicate submission, data
              fabrication, or any other form of academic misconduct. The
              platform has a built-in system to check similarity indices and use
              of profanity in the article.{" "}

            <p className="pera-text">
              We expect all Publishing Editors to be conscious of the decisions
              they make and in rare cases the platform could call upon an
              individual to review their decision with Aakashganga admin. Every
              Publishing Editor should fill in the relevant section of the
              Review Form as precisely as possible. The platform is automated
              and hence we expect the job of providing rationale simplified and
              direct. Editors are encouraged to make every reasonable endeavour
              to ensure timely processing of submissions.

            <h2 className="large-title">Process of Article Selection</h2>

            <p className="pera-text">
              For every article submitted to Aakashganga, the process of
              selection of a Publishing Editor for editorial assessment is
              automated without any human intervention. The system seeks out the
              best match amongst the various individuals who have opted to be
              Publishing Editors for a specific Mega Journal. Once the system
              allots a Publishing Editor, they (the publishing editor) will have
              a dedicated dashboard on which all processes will be recorded. As
              a Publishing Editor you are free to decline to provide any
              editorial assessment for an article. However, we request that this
              option be used only as an exception.
            </p>

              <strong>Process of Article Selection â€“ </strong>
              Administrators at Aakashganga are however authorized to reassign,
              or withdraw the invitation to review an article (for editorial
              assessment) without assigning any reason whatsoever. Generally
              where a Publishing Editor is unresponsive for a reasonable period
              of time, such action will be necessitated to keep the publishing
              process on track.

            <p className="pera-text">
              Every Publishing Editor accepting our invitation by virtue of the
