        To ensure fairness and impartiality, our platform follows a
        double-anonymous review model. This means that both the reviewers and
        authors remain anonymous throughout the review process. Anonymity helps
        eliminate biases that could arise based on the authorâ€™s identities,
        affiliations, or previous work. It allows for an objective evaluation of
        the research paper solely on its scientific merits.
