					Ultimately, actions speak louder than words. We are
					committed to consistently supporting the research community
					to be able to share their research with the world. No
					researcher should ever have to hold their brilliance because
					they are facing financial constraint.
				</p>

				<p className='pera-text px-lg-0 px-3'>
					We believe that every idea in this world has the scope to
					expand into something that will benefit the mankind.
					Therefore, we pride ourselves on upholding affordable APCs,
					high-quality publishing standards, ethical and transparent
					practices to achieve this mission.

				<p className='pera-text px-lg-0 px-3'>
					We are committed to conveying the value and affordability of
					the Article Processing Charges (APCs) to our researchers.
					This is crucial to us for building trust with you and
					attracting the right kind of submissions.
				</p>

				<p className='pera-text px-lg-0 px-3'>
					That is why we display our pricing transparently, without
					any hidden charges so that you know what you are signing up
					for. This page is also updated regularly to host the current
					promotions, discounts and grants available to you.

					<strong>Global Outreach:</strong> We are striving to break

					only available to Indian nationals.

					further because of the array of discounts that we will
					continuously provide, including referral discounts, launch
					discounts, promotional period discounts, and institutional
					discounts amongst others.{" "}

					*You will be able to access these discounts in your Mudra
					Kosh section in your account.

					<strong>Collaboration with Institutions:</strong> We also
					welcome partnerships with academic institutions, research
					organizations and societies, which may help contribute to
					lowering costs for researchers affiliated with these
					institutions.

					<strong>Supporting Early-Career Researchers:</strong> Our
					commitment to nurturing young researchers by offering lower
					costs for Tier 2 and Tier 3 cities (in India) affirms our

				<p className='px-lg-0 px-3'>
					<strong>Quality and Impact:</strong> We have automated our
					platform 95%, and with technology as our partner, our
					quality of output is high. This means we are able to cut
					through the manual intervention and offer you low APCs while
					you can build a strong impact by publishing with us.
					Researchers want value for their investment, and we are more
					than willing to bring it to the table.
